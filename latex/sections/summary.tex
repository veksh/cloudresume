I am a Unix, Database and Network Engineer and Software Developer with over 25 years of experience. I have held various roles such as ERP developer, Oracle DBA, Unix and VMware engineer, network designer, Data Centre architect, and Infrastructure Team Leader.

My main areas of expertise are Unix/Linux server and application administration, LANs, virtualisation with VMware, IaC and automation, monitoring, DBMS, scripting and software development. I am always eager to learn new technologies and languages, and to try things I have never done before.
