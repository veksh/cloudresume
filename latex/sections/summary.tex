I am an Infrastructure Engineer and Software Developer with over 25 years of diverse IT experience, now specializing in DevOps and Cloud technologies. With a strong background in data centre design, Unix administration and SRE, networking, and automation, I have further expanded my expertise into cloud platforms, container orchestration, and modern DevOps practices. I am an AWS Certified DevOps Engineer and Certified Kubernetes Administrator, and proficient in Go, Python, and Ruby. Having recently relocated to the UK, I am eager to apply my comprehensive skill set and newly acquired knowledge in a challenging DevOps, SRE or Cloud Engineering role.
