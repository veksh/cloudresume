        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Unix, DB and Network Engineer and Software Developer with over 25 years of experience. I have a diverse IT background and have held various roles like ERP software developer, Unix and VMWare administrator, SRE, network designer, data centre architect, DevOps engineer, Oracle DBA, and IT Infrastructure Team Leader for a medium-sized (7000+ employees) retail company. I'm a <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/35cd73fb-d95d-4f98-b7ce-caa6664475dc/public_url">Certified Kubernetes Administrator</a> and <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/5b2e59d4-7b92-4512-a27f-3766fd520ad6">AWS Certified DevOps Engineer</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main areas of technical expertise are Linux administration, Data Centre virtualisation and services, LAN design and operations, enterprise mail and collaboration software, file sharing and Active Directory services, infrastructure automation and IaC, scripting and software development, system and application monitoring, relational databases, enterprise storage, high availability and business continuity, site reliability engineering, network monitoring and security.
        </p>
        <p>
            My current interests include infrastructure automation (Ansible, Terraform, Crossplane), containerisation and orchestration (Kubernetes, Helm), cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP), DevOps and GitOps (GitHub, GitLab, AgroCD), software development (Go), and monitoring (Grafana, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry). I'm always eager to learn new technologies and languages, and to try things I've never done before.
